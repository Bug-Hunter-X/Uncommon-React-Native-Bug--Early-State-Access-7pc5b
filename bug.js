This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been properly initialized within a functional component.  This commonly happens when you use the state variable within the component's render function before the `useState` hook has had a chance to set its initial value.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Error: count might be undefined here!
  console.log(count); 

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
